#NUMBER GENERATOR 

* Identify numbers from convo neural net
* Something like this can be done easily using libraries but I like to make myself suffer 
* Works 8 out of 10 times correctly, I trained it through MNIST dataset as I could not find anything else
* This was not that fun project
* Moreover this has been a tremendous waste of time but my OCD did not let me abandon this project
* I bet I will spend countless hours in vein for this project
* Why am I writing this?Nobody sees my projects
